🏥 MedDigitise

AI-Powered Medical Text Digitisation & EMR System

📌 Overview

MedDigitise is an AI-powered mobile application that digitizes handwritten medical prescriptions and clinical notes into structured Electronic Medical Records (EMR).

The system combines Flutter (Frontend), Node.js + Express (Backend), Python FastAPI (AI OCR Service), and MySQL (Database) to deliver a complete end-to-end medical digitisation pipeline.

It is designed for real-world clinical environments to reduce paperwork and improve record accuracy.
